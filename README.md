## 📺 TV Advertising Placement Optimization
This is a project from my participation in 2020 & 2021 [Marketing Analysis Competition](https://www.is.nri.co.jp/contest/2021/report.html) hosted by Nomura Research Institute(NRI).  
The competition aimed to propose advertising marketing strategies based on insights gained through data analysis from diverse perspevtives.  

I developed a marketing strategy for a company to optimize TV advertising placement considering cost and effectiveness such as target reaching.
I was awarded as a **Top Finalist**🎖️ out of 110+ teams for **2 consecutive years**.
