## 📺 TV Advertising Placement Optimization
This is a project when I joined [2020&2021 Marketing Analysis Competition](https://www.is.nri.co.jp/contest/2021/report.html) hosted by Nomura Research Institute whose goal is to propose advertising marketing strategy based on insights through data analysis from a diverse perspevtive.
In this competition, I was awareded as a **Top Finalist** out of 110+ teams for 2 consecutive years.

### 🎯 Objective
In this project, I developed an optimized TV advertising placement strategy.
1) Identify the optimal ad viewing frequency that maximizes purchase intention.
2) Determine the relationship between the optimal viewing frequency and ad content features.
3) Develop the standards of ad placement based on the results of 1) and 2).

### 📁 Dataset Used
Data is provided by Nomura Research Institute, so it cannot be opened in public.
- Survey data
The following metrics includes:
  - 3,000 individual demographics
  - Purchase intention and behoviour each items or services before and after viewing TV ad    
- TV show viewship data
This tells whether a person viewed TV show during the survey period.
- TV ad placement data
This tells what and when TV ads were placed on TV show.

### ⚙️ Data Processing & Aggregation
I aggreagated the percentage of purchase intention from survey responses and ad viewing frequency each items and services.
Below is the result of agreegation for a payment service which is called 'PayPay'.
-> Hypothesis: It is predicted that there might be optimal viewing frequency and it varies by items and services.
